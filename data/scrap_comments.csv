"Safety is the major advantage of sodium ion battery other than lithium ion battery with small capacity sacrifice. However, CATL also announced new condensed matter battery, which have way better capacity and safety and fast charging features over both lithium and sodium ion batteries. glad to see the battery technology fast evolving."
"The thermal runaway of lithium batteries has mostly been resolved with the design of the 4680 cell which distributes the heat more efficiently and as long as you don't try to draw all the energy out all at once.  Also, there is a new method of extracting lithium which is more environmentally sustainable.
That being said, I do like that the big battery manufacturers are pursuing sodium batteries which does seem more practical in the long run for mass production at lower cost."
Looking forward to the implementation of sodium batteries on a massive scale.
"It will be interesting to see which new technology, silicon-io vs. sodium-ion, batteries take the lead.  SIlicon offers significant higher energy densities and a 20- minute (vice 60-minute for Lithium-ion) charge time for a vehicle.  My understaning, however, is that silicon just replaces graphite, but lithium is still used in the silicon battery."
"My major complaint with Lithium-Ion batteries are the inherited characteristics of Nickel-Cadmium batteries in that they want to be fully discharged and then charged up. I have noticed a lot of loss of longevity in partial charging on account of this. Sometimes I've had to replace a perfectly working device because the lithium-Ion battery went kaput! I tend to want to charge my items when they reach 30%. So even in my tablet or smartphone, one of these would be a good thing to have. Better temperature stability is another very big plus of this battery too. Electric cars in the dead of winter in Michigan would have better range and you could quick charge them as well. I'm looking forward to this! Yes we got the soda ash, so let's get to making them here!"
"Sodium chloride (common salt) is generally a more abundant and economical source of sodium than sodium carbonate (soda ash), which is less abundant and typically produced through a multi-step chemical process."
"Imagine a standard battery cell module that is mandated for EV vehicles, like a cartridge. Module packs can range from 50 miles to 100 miles ect... and instead of ""fueling up"" you just replace your pack(s) in an auto bay, drive in, swap and move along. Of course this would require billions upon billions of dollars in infrastructure, design and collaboration,  however it would essential solve all of EV ""issues"" and thanks to advancements on battery tech like this sodium battery, its only a matter of when and if instead of how."
"With the current (lithium ion) batteries, they tell you not to deplete them to below 20%, but I have heard that would not be an issue with sodium ion batteries."
"The development of sodium ion batteries is encouraging, but I do wonder about the energy density problem.  That could be offset by developments in better solar energy, so that a vehicle powered by sodium ion batteries could have that charge maintained by a body composed of solar cells.  Add to that the isntallation of more charging stations, and we may be looking at a big slice of the near future of transportation."
"I think it's a good idea to get away from mining cobalt, nickel, etc. With respect to this, CATL is doing really good things. I wish them great success."
"And hopefully they will be porting these sodium batteries to in portable electronic market. 

AA, AAA, C, D and other rechargeable battery sizes would quickly take off. Maybe even for cell phones as well"
"Sodium weighs almost 4 times more than Lithium.. With this weight and lack of the capacity, Sodium seems to be pretty far from being used in EVs at least for now."
"The energy density and limited recharge cycles will keep these batteries out of vehicles. It could find some use in storage batteries, where the size is not as important and there is no issue with range."
It would be great to see the US get out of its own way and lead the way in EV production and technology.  Interesting that Tessa just had to recall every single car it sold in China. What story there? And we are learning that there is huge investment in lithium mining in southern CA.  The new ‚ÄúLithium Valley‚Äù is reported to have more supply of this mineral compared to China.  Is the US going to support a cleaner technology of sodium or use the same logic of coal mining and continue to produce energy that increase CO2? My guess is that big business will only look to short term gains as it always does and dig for more lithium and watch as China goes ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and in 20 years become the leader in battery technology.
"These won't be as efficient as Li-ion but the price would be dirt cheap compared to lithium batteries if everything goes well.
But it won't necessarily be a huge break through in battery tech rather make a few things easier.

However the world is waiting for a different battery technology with more high energy density, no explosion risk and abundance. Such as the gryphene battery that was promised."
"I think there is a Chinese company that actually has ""battery swapping stations"" I can't remember the name but is there any way that company can incorporate the sodium batteries or would it be logistically not possible? Would be great for the environment to just be able to swap batteries around instead of recycling^ "
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing Pakistan's soda ash reserves. In 2017, the government of Pakistan awarded a 25-year lease to a Chinese company to develop a soda ash mine in the Salt Range. The mine is expected to start production in 2023 and will have a production capacity of 1 million tons per year."
This is incredible. We have more durable batteries which are cheaper to build and more friendly for environment.
Sodium ion technologies have been out for 20 years.  I am happy to see it became commercialized in a 20 year window.
sounds cool to me. wonder how well they work
Small correction: the density is 160 Watt hours per kg not Kilowatt hours per kg
"Great very detailed and to the point video article you posted mate . On the other hand there are many ways of manipulating the market, I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyze the digital market , all that changed when i encountered (Draymus Willow) strategy. more emphasis should be put into day trading as it Is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market."
"It will change nothing in 2023, 24, 25, or even 26 but it may change things after then. This is still at early stage development and wh/m for sodium (range) is a long way today behind any lithium based solution.  Mass production at scale, once sodium is ACTUALLY a commercially useable solution will take time, even after 2026. But in principle the data from several labs is looking promising. If it is so good and achievable at scale quickly, Tesla, LG chem, CATL etc would not be investing so heavily in production, to its own refining of lithium based technology (Tesla), would they?"
"According to my knowledge, Israel and India are jointly doing excellent work on Sodium Battery technology. And many automobile companies have also completed the successful trial of Sodium Battery. Soon Sodium Battery will be available for public use."

"Very soon, you get to customize your car with the battery of your choice - lithium, sodium, aluminium, so on and so forth - with and without solar charging from the painted body and the glass. Some day nuclear battery (safe from misuse/radiation) that lasts longer than the car where you can throw the old car and port the battery to the new car of your choice."
What do you think ?  is there any chance for sodium ion battery to  reach  250Wh /kg  ?   I think that we need  500Wh /kg to make  electric mobility revolution
"Innovation, innovation, China leads the world in innovation.
This is why China has come so far so fast, and this trend
will not end no time soon."
The sodium-ion battery was developed by Aquion Energy of the United States in 2009.
Would China be so dominant in the  sodium battery market? I don't think so. This might weaken they're grip on the battery market since like he said sodium is very abundant. Technology will not be held back.
"160kw/ kg, I'll take 3 for my Mitsubishi minicab miev, I'd love a 247 kg weight saving and 300 times the range."
Only china can do something revolutionary in this field to bring down prices
"I think battery for used with home solar system doesn't need to be compact or light weight as for EV, also not need strong storage frame like for car moving in traffic. Do you know what kind of battery best suited for home solar system?"
Was expecting such a breakthrough when India discovered Li deposits
"If the North American government‚Äôs had spent money on R&D instead of giving handouts for PEVs ,maybe we would be ahead in this battery game ."
"The cost of KW/h will drive the market price of any energy storage material.  I'm sure with the marketing of Sodium ion batteries we will see a price drop in KW/h to gain market share, but once the market has sustained a $80 Kw/h price to consumers that will always increase from this day forth...  I like the innovation of a cleaner more readily avail be product but don't keep your hopes up this will make things cheaper."
"The biggest problem in the modern world is reliance on economic platforms which often depend on scarcity and debt to create wealth. Abundance of material resources is antithetical to such platforms. And they can‚Äôt answer actual needs not only for materials or resources but also protection from collateral damage from toxic outputs which though a separate question for the platform itself directly affects every user even the profiteer. Overall, this is how I define whether a system is sustainable. The most benefit for the most people and the environs and other entities coexisting and interdependent with whatever system is in current use."
good innovations - looking forward from Japan to pitch in - their Quality is long lasting for sure...
"My building in nyc has banned us from owning any lithium battery mobility products like escooter so I'm waiting for an alternative tech to come out. May be sodium battery is it. There must be a market for it, for people living in highrise building where the management have been banning lithium battery for fire safety reason."
Great video. Highest density (of information) of Li vs Na batteries
"It's a hit for Asia, but not in more affluent markets where EV prices are over $45k. All those Asian Cars are smaller, so the battery can be smaller. Also, people don't drive as far and only need 200km of range. In USA people want big SUVs with good acceleration. li-ion is better for that."
Life span of a sodium battery?  If i compare to Lithium ion?
"Hope it isn't a molten salt battery that is mainly used in the military due to the extremely dangerous, corrosive, explosion, can not use water in case of fire."
"Cool! We can just fill up the tank with the salt shaker


If you want some 'extra pep'

Try pepper, chilli flakes or in the case of Porsches Cayenne manual, recommend to use CAYENNE pepper!"
2:40 microvast separators eliminates these issues. General motors ultium will have them.
"So in the near future a 4 cell sodium ion battery will be storing 400KW/hr of energy that was charged from the solar cells on my roof, and the amount stored in the batteries is more than enough to keep my full house running for at least 5 days if the electricity goes down?"
"I am a PhD in Lib /mechanical engineering 
I heard about this battery in 2014"
Would be very interesting if they take the brine from desalination plants and recycle it to make sodium batteries.  Way better option than releasing the brine back into the ecosystem.
It is a good news in EV industry for the new inventor
How long does it take to charge?  Charge time is what will make hydrogen the dominant energy source.
"CATL just announced 270WH/KG Sodium battery,while the US is busy sending money to Ukraine. Keep going please both!"
Let‚Äôs get these NA ion batteries for home back up power.
"If you want to completely ruin your battery business for EV, make your battery with sodium. 
Sodium battery is ,at best ,fitted for Electricity Storage System."
"Maybe Current sodium ion tech is equals to when iphone was just iphone 3. Every success has a starting point, this is the first step to  success for sodium ion battery...."
"The cost of battery replacement is the main factor that people on the edge of purchasing a EV. Stories of people being charged $20,000 to replace batteries in their EV'S is unacceptable, so the much cheaper sodium batteries would be the biggest factor in getting people to buy EV's in the large numbers countries want. Safety and cost are other pluses."
"In 1910, Edison created Sodium Ion battery tech. & fitted into a Bailey Electric vehicle, which he drove for 1000 miles endurance test on 1 charge & even better you can empty a depleted sodium ion battery liquid down the drain and unlike lithium Ion won't poison the water supply or ground."
will this effect the price  of table salt.
"Sodium based batteries look promising, especially if it is mining and refining is far cleaner than minerals used in lithium batteries.  If China leads the way on this, America start learning chinese, unless you capitalise on the salt deposits you have, ASAP."
This invention may go silent over time like all those past inventions.
another miracle of the week that will change the world forever? not crossing any fingers.
"Everything here look at positive. But its not as dense and can't hold charge. If you try to use it for the same price per weight, sodium is still more expensive until its rollout that would be 2040. And about thermal runaway, is now safer with lithium iron. Anyways thanks for the vid."
Revolutional Battery ... once more ...
"knowing all these, why did they choose to use lithium instead of sodium from the start ? periodic tables are not made like 2-3 years ago."
Is it water proof?
"One problem is that Sodium Batteries should be available for home storage use for backup power. Second, makers greed for profits and market share. Third, even if the US can produce the Batteries cheaper, who buy them?? America doesn't have creditablitty for being a reliable partner in business. There more reasons 5o list but I made my point."
"Its still in the early stages hope for the best that humans may crack it down one day or if someone does they being killed out of hate, jealousy & anger ! 

So one of the main challenges of sodium batteries is their lower energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries, which means they may not be able to store as much energy in the same amount of space. 

Additionally, sodium batteries may have issues with stability and safety due to the highly reactive nature of sodium. They also may require different materials for their electrodes and electrolytes compared to lithium-ion batteries, which could lead to higher costs and longer development times. 

Finally, there are also challenges related to scaling up the production of sodium batteries to meet the demands of large-scale applications.

"The Mercedes EQXX is twice as efficient as a Tesla Model S.  So if you put a 50kWh sodium ion battery in an EQXX it would equal the range of a Model S with a 100kWh battery.

If our phones, laptops and so on were built to be more efficient, then these batteries could replace lithium batteries in almost everything.

And they could make grid level storage (for backup of solar/wind farms) then we could go 100% renewable grids worldwide immediately."
"Its staggering how many channels make segments on batteries and make sweeping claims about ""thermal runaway for Lithium Ion"" like there is only one chemistry and they are all flammable....Makes you wonder what else they are getting wrong. I expect Ev's to become much cheaper than gas cars and so they should, once batteries have been properly scaled they are much simpler and cheaper and faster to make."
"As long as i can get more than 100km out of a battery, im happy. I dont drive more than than in a day"
"How about the efficiency of sodium battery? Will it better than lithium? Nope it won't. 

Meaning for an electric SUV or pickup truck, there are more sodium batteries than lithium. It means the vehicles will be more heavier and wasting more power"
Same reliance also making in India
I can't wait for a bright mind to use this tech to replace my nissan leaf. this is all what I need in life and not expensive af teslas.
"was hoping the bloom energy cell would replace battery tech.  fuel cell tech is several decades old,
the easiest to fill being via methane, the cleanest via hydrogen."
Awesome video thank you
This looks very promising. I look forward to never hearing about it again.
BYD already have blade battery which only available for BYD vehicle
"As a farmer. I can tell you that sodium's excess causes a soil condition known as sodicity and there is enough (and sodium) in this world that, if taken onboard, the farmers will happily collect all this soda that comes to the surface during winters or allow companies to rid them of it for free and very happily. Humanity can thus kill two birds with one stone. But this is all wishful thinking after all, there must be many rich, policy influencing people and they will compute what is better and more suited to their needs and wants. Otherwise someone somewhere is liable to pop up with a eighteenth century patent on the technology to shut it down."
"No it won't! There are many problems with sodium batteries...but to name a few...they don't hold the same voltage, they don't hold it as long, very very low amps.....they last half as long and cannot be recycled! They ONLY upside is they don't pollute as much a lithium."
Waiting for that MSG battery‚Ä¶ 
"By all means improve batteries, but make sure a Hydrogen Fuel Cell is charging them - that way we need 80% less of them and considerably less environmental damage is done . .

Its assets were sold to a Chinese manufacturer Juline-Titans, who abandoned most of Aquion's patents, most but not all.

TLDR: Research is expensive so let's make profit by selling this tech to the Chinese and buy it back for pennies on the dollar."

but what about Platinum Battery?
We still need fossil fuels to charge them . Electric cars won‚Äôt drop the carbon emissions by much.
Lithium battery cars made wrong is like driving in an electracution chair around. 
But their ev's keep blowing up.  I'll wait for Tesla to come out with theirs.  Kinda of trust their scientist and engineers first.
"Wrong.  Na batteries will have almost zero influence in 2023.   It will pick up a bit next few years but there isn't a huge gigafactory line up for these, nor do I expect it to be even in the future.  Why?  Low energy density, Li energy density expected to increase dramatically with solid state Li, half the cycle time life of Li and other parts of the Na batteries actually being more expensive than Li batteries.  A battery isn't just lithium or sodium costs.  Finally, it takes many years to roll out the tens of billion dollar infrastructure that is the lithium ion battery supply chain, not to mention the VASTLY more dollars that are in Li R&D, so this can't happen overnight (clearly not in 2023 as the video headline claims)."
This is a new and latest energy source
EV will fix nothing - the energy to run EV will still be fossil fuels. Except there will be the extra burden of disposing of massive inefficient electric batteries.
Elon musk may have thought of this 10 year back
This will ready to release after 50 years not now
But sodium can damage the soil
"the interesting thing about them, they always feel like they are doing the first to create, even though they are only imitating the results of other people's development, after being tested the results will not last long, this is just a gimmick"
That is genius invations  maybe someday this society can made nuke betry for smartphone.
All it needs is one drop of rain in an uninsulated area of battery and fireworks will begin.
When I see it on aliexpress i will believe it

sodium silicon battery will amazing
Sodium can make the battery life longer
Needs to think about the environment also.use of litithium will cause the effect on environment and also pollutes the drinking water .those are 2 important in our life to sustain.

now.. the BYD EV-s are burning up all over the world.. might be that they cracked it now. it might be safe but i doubt it. just sales talk here.. to boost a thing :D
Good to know.
I will believe when it is in vehicles. I have heard plenty of bs.
better start buying table salt
I guess its only a hype abt sodium battery. BTW sodium power is less dense than lithium power.
So its more like diesel vs petrol vehicles.
Which company sodium battery production
lithium lower in price... a finite resource with demand increasing...... the price can only go up..... hydrogen on the other hand is an infinite resource thaat has scope for technological advancements in separating and therefore will see the cost lower
Ev will not have long market as H2ICE will take over... clean and efficient then conversational fossils fuel ICE and EV or FCV...
"No 1 - Safety
No 2 - Fast charge

"Sounds like a product advertisement but interesting. It's not just technology, it's the attitude of the governments, For the Chinese it is prosperity and long-term national interest, for the Americans it is profit and private interest, So I don't think the Americans have any ability against the Chinese."
Do you wanna know what else electric cars will change forever? Your electric bill.
Hope this is true 
Why is he talking about soda ash? Can they just use the sodium from salt which is very abundant instead?
That would be the tech the USA gave away then.
So good
So to sum this up: soon we will not be able to afford salt to add it to our food...
does it fit in my watch
Sodium battery are really exists
I think the engine made by Toyota will outperform the battery‚Äôs

"Why not cut a deal with China for cheap sodium ion batteries and guarantee them access to the soda ash they need? Win/Win, not everything has to be a competition."
Lithium is bad. That's a given. At 2.36 you still haven't got to the point.
There's only One Problem! in Capitalism nothing get cheaper? Videos host isn't familiar how Capitalism's greed works!!
REALLY?????
Made in China. You know what that means. 
Old video.
China is not leading the charge on sodium battery tech.
chynese BS 
"Change Everything, Desroy"
This is bull.
"My only question is , who did china steal this technology from ?"
Chinese....haaa haaa
too much repetitive talk throughout the video!
"CHINESE PROPAGANDA... using words like ""expect"", ""should"", ""host of benefits"", ""game changer"", ""get you excited""...   AND... if you need salt on your burger you can just puncture one of your batteries... right now trusting China is a bit sketchy since they are having a problem with vehicle fires caused by the batteries they are currently manufacturing in Chinese vehicles..."
carbon dioxide doesn't cause global warming.
"Your rambling contradicts itself so many times, it becomes laughable. Sodium will replace lithium in 2023, sodium is at least 10 years behind lithium, CATL sodium is reaching lithium density, Sodium is too low in density, it is only good for storage batteries, and you go on and on saying nothing of value."
"stock videos, crappy text to speech audio. another channel to avoid."
Wonder what University  China stole this tech from ?
I don‚Äôt cate about anything Chinese!!!
too much talking
These batteries are trash...
Clickbait
Again?
Fake news
Stop destroying the planet...use batteries...it uses no power to charge and no power stations required some day soon. What a joke..............
"Tohle blbnut√≠ s bateriemi skonƒç√≠ pƒõknou ekologickou katastrofou . Souƒçasn√Ω model pokud se rychle nezmƒõn√≠ bude znamenat vƒõt≈°√≠ ekologickou z√°tƒõ≈æ ne≈æ spalov√°n√≠ uhl√≠ , plynu a ropy ."
Be Why De
Why are we screwing the Earth again???????????????????????
I don‚Äôt know why i don‚Äôt trust Chinese  everything is fake ‚Ä¶
Chinese propaganda film.
"chinese invention, ha ha never trust"
Chinese BS.
